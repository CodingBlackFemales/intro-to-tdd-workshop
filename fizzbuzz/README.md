# FizzBuzz Exercise

## Task

Write a method that takes a number and returns:

- "Fizz" for multiples of 3
- "Buzz" for multiples of 5
- "FizzBuzz" for multiples of 3 and 5
- The number when it is neither of the above

For example, for numbers 1 to 15, we would expect the method to return the following:

| Input | Output     |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 1     | 1          |
| 2     | 2          |
| 3     | "Fizz"     |
| 4     | 4          |
| 5     | "Buzz"     |
| 6     | "Fizz"     |
| 7     | 7          |
| 8     | 8          |
| 9     | "Fizz"     |
| 10    | "Buzz"     |
| 11    | 11         |
| 12    | "Fizz"     |
| 13    | 13         |
| 14    | 14         |
| 15    | "FizzBuzz" |
