# Intro to TDD Workshop

A starter setup for partipants of the Coding Black Females Test-Driven Development workshop

## Getting Started

This setup uses the programming language [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), and the testing tool [RSpec](https://rspec.info/).

1. If you don't have Ruby installed, please follow the instructions here:
   [https://www.codecademy.com/articles/ruby-setup](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/ruby-setup). Install Ruby version 2.4.2 or above, instead of 2.2.0.

2. Please ensure you have a code editor installed on your machine, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. Please ensure you're comfortable navigating directories using the `cd` command in the terminal / command line

2. If downloaded, unzip the file into a directory of your choice
3. Open the directory in your code editor
4. Open the terminal. In VS Code, this can be done by navigating to the menu at the top and selecting:
   `Terminal > New Terminal`
5. There are two sub-directories within the directory called `fizzbuzz` and `leap_year`. In your terminal, navigate to one of the subdirectories, and run the following to install the required packages:
